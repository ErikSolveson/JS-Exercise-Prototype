  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

/* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Global Context (binding): 'this' in this context is reffering to the whole window and shows all the methods and data possible!
    2. Implicit Binding: 'this' in the implicit binding context is where you can use 'this to show the whole object that it is inside of. Also in this context, if you're calling a method then 'this' is the object to the left of the dot used to call the method.
    3. New Binding: this is the binding where the 'this' is refering to object that is being instantiated with the new keyword.
    4. Explicit Binding: Explicit is weird in that you're using a perviously created object and then calling that object, but with a different object's values. So that the 'this' refers to the object being called in the () rather than what is left of the dot.
